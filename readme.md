# ✨ Shiny ✨

## What is Shiny?

Shiny is a UI library based on the [clay](https://github.com/kraxarn/clay) layout library.
It's primarily intended for use SDL3 and C, and designed around the [chirp](https://github.com/kraxarn/chirp)
game engine, but I can't stop you from using it for other purposes as well.

## Status

Currently in a very early state, very much pre-pre-alpha.

## Why the name "Shiny"?

"Shinies" are usually referred to some kind of distracting, often shiny, item,
sometimes associated with crows and similar bird that likes to collect shiny
items. The name Shiny is a play on this, as a kind of shiny UI.

## Showcase

The [caw](https://github.com/kraxarn/caw) tracker is currently being built alongside Shiny,
but neither are finished enough to use it as a showcase.
